//! The protocol for vhost-user is based on the existing implementation of
//! vhost for the Linux Kernel. The protocol defines two sides of the
//! communication, master and slave. Master is the application that shares
//! its virtqueues. Slave is the consumer of the virtqueues.
//!
//! The communication channel between the master and the slave includes two
//! sub channels. One is used to send requests from the master to the slave
//! and optional replies from the slave to the master. This sub channel is
//! created on master startup by connecting to the slave service endpoint.
//! The other is used to send requests from the slave to the master and
//! optional replies from the master to the slave. This sub channel is
//! created by the master issuing a VHOST_USER_SET_SLAVE_REQ_FD request to
//! the slave with an auxiliary file descriptor.
//!
//! Unix domain socket is used as the underlying communication channel because
//! the master needs to send file descriptors to the slave.
//!
//! Most messages that can be sent via the Unix domain socket implementing
//! vhost-user have an equivalent ioctl to the kernel implementation.
